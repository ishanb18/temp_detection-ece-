# Nexyus 4DDR Project 🚀

A hardware development project for Nexyus 4DDR using Xilinx Vivado. This repository contains all necessary files to open and work with the project in Vivado, targeting the Nexyus 4DDR board.

## 📌 Author

**Ishan Bansal**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `project_1.xpr`: Vivado project file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 💡 What This Project Does

This project implements a custom digital system on the **Nexyus 4DDR FPGA board**. Depending on the design file contents (not visible in this preview), typical functions could include:

- Digital logic design (e.g., counters, ALUs, or state machines)
- Peripheral interfacing (e.g., buttons, switches, LEDs, 7-segment displays)
- Clock division or generation
- Memory interaction (with onboard DDR or internal registers)
- Testbench simulation and validation

The design is built to run on the Nexyus 4DDR development board and can serve as a base for more advanced digital logic or embedded system development projects.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite** (recommended version: 2020.2 or later)
- Nexyus 4DDR board and drivers
- USB-JTAG cable for programming

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open Vivado.
2. Use `File` > `Open Project` and select `project_1.xpr`.
3. Synthesize, implement, and generate bitstream.
4. Program the Nexyus 4DDR board via the Hardware Manager.
